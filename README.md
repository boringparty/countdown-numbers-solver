# Countdown Number Solver

This was written entirely with chatGPT with no changes. I use a spreadsheet for playing along and sometimes Rachel can't even figure it out... but entering the values manually is a pain. This can take `?target=454&numbers=75,4,7,6,10,1` at the end of the URL to make life easier.

That's it. This is just for me.
